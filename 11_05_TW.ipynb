        "TEAMWORK: Steps (for simplifying the code logic): Step 1: Print a welcoming message to the player. Step 2: Initialize variables to keep track of the number of correct guesses and the total number of guesses. Step 3: Use a while loop to keep the game running until the player decides to quit. Step 4: If the player enters 'quit', exit the game loop. Step 5: Ask the player to guess the outcome of the coin toss (heads or tails). Step 6: Generate a random number (0 or 1) to represent the outcome of the coin toss. (If the number is 0, the outcome is heads. If it's 1, the outcome is tails.) Step 7: Compare the player's guess with the generated outcome. Step 8: Increment the correct and total number of guesses"
